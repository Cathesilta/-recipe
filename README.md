This recipe reflects a highly personal taste, primarily intended as an archive and reminder.
But in a case anyone would be interested, I'm still adding some instructions.

Will not include any I haven't made.

>First boil pork belly in water with green onions, ginger, and garlic. For 10 cm thick pork, 90 mins.
>
>Then fry it to make the golden surface
>
>Then boil it in water with the paste made by mix of apple, onions, garlic, Japanese soy sauce, and mirin. For 10 cm thick pork, more than 30 mins.

>Tonkotsu doesn't make significant difference for deliciousness, it just looks awesome but with high purine, careful!
>
>Sesame, fungus, Pickled scallions in ice water, メンマ(I see this in every Ramen in Asahikawa). 鳴門巻き? Doesn't have to, just like a decoration.
